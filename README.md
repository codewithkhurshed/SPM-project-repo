##Idea: 
Our AI-driven PDF Chatbot is specialized for Project Management (PM) Automation and acts as a virtual Project Manager that offers continuous support to global teams. It interprets PDF data like SRS reports and interview transcripts by utilizing Open-Assistant's SFT-1 12B Model. Insights from interviews of 15 project managers have enriched the knowledge base of our chatbot and ultimately enabled informative responses to the stakeholders of the project. Advanced AI techniques ensure efficient text preprocessing, including tokenization, numerical normalization, lowercasing, removing punctuation, removing extra spaces, recursive character text splitter, and lemmatization. It is primarily tailored for e-commerce project and provides precise guidance based on e-commerce data and risk management factors. With an average cosine similarity of 80.80\% and semantic similarity score of 85.21\%, it consistently aligns with PDF Contents and optimize the project management phases \& methodologies. This innovation enhances Human-Robot Interaction, PM Automation, facilitates decision-making, and enables uninterrupted communication.

##Our Contribution:

1) Custom Dataset.
2) Advanced Preprocessing.
3) First to implement AI-driven PDF Chatbot which is specialized for **Project Management (PM) Automation and acts as a virtual Project Manager**.
